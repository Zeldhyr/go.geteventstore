#Reading and writing events

This example demonstrates how to use the goes client to write events and event metadata to a stream and then read them back.

The example is simple and well commented and should explain how everything works.

Once the server is up simply **go run** main.go from the read-write-event directory.

```
$ go run main.go
```
